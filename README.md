# rubenOS

Too many Linux distributions to pick from? Windows and Mac - stealing your data and selling it for profit?

Well don't worry... RubenOS is here! 

Inspired by three things:

1. My dad ( may he rest in peace - best dad ever, he would have impressed - my parents are my number one fans ) hence Ruben his nickname :) 
2. OS in 1,000 lines ( amazing blogs and tutorial on how to even tackle building an OS and how an OS even works )
3. TempleOS ( Very controversial - but gotta give the man credit for building his own OS and programming language and really pushed me to think "if he can do it, why can't I???" type vibe )

We don't gatekeep, here are the resources I used ( aside from Stack Overflow - my bestie ):

And if any recruiters see this... well... at this point I've given up - no point in trying to be professional or limiting myself on what I can say or do - this is who I am.
